            <h1>PR Background</h1>
            <p>I&#39;m the founder of C1 Revolution. Clients hire me because of my expertise in
                brand reputation and management (you can get a better sense of what that
                means over at the services page). Brand work includes Portillo&#39;s, Four
                Seasons Mexico City, Bank of America 2017 Chicago Marathon, Flowers for
                Dreams and more.
                Prior to starting C1, I worked on comms teams for Walgreens, DePaul
                University, MLB&#39;s Chicago White Sox and iHeart Media.

                Being curious about the industry and how people successfully navigate the
                digital revolution led me to create #theRevolutionaries, an interview series
                tackling the topic, distributed by Entrepreneur.
                And last, if you haven&#39;t guessed, I love coming up with wild ideas and bringing
                them to life. Here&#39;s two projects I&#39;m particularly proud of: Harry Potter Yoga
                and #BarackingAround (they went viral within three months of each other). </p>

            <h1>Freelance Writing</h1>
            <p>In the last year I&#39;ve published articles in Food &amp; Wine, munchies, Atlas
                Obscura, New York Magazine, Bitch, Tasting Table and more. This has led
                people to ask if I&#39;ve made a career switch from PR.
                It&#39;s actually the other way around. I went into PR because I couldn&#39;t find a job
                as a writer when I graduated from DePaul with a Master&#39;s in Journalism (my
                undergrad degree is in communication). I tried writing back then and landed
                bylines with Refinery29, Chicago Sun-Times and Forbes. However, I wasn&#39;t
                ready to hustle the way I am today.
                Through my PR work, I connected with Food52&#39;s Amanda Hesser who
                encouraged me to take up writing again. Today, I write a lot more. Not
                because I&#39;m giving up PR, but because it&#39;s a different way to publicize the
                topics I care about. One feeds the other.
                As a result, I&#39;m better equipped to help clients. Being on the other side of
                pitches helps me understand how sharp my work needs to be in order to
                break through the noise. </p>
